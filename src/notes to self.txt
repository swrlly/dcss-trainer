## winform stuff

to convert from command line tool to windows forms:
- linker -> system -> subsystem windows
- config properties -> advanced
   - CLR support - enable
   - .NET Target Framework Version - v4.7.2
   - Enable managed... Yes

- right click -> Add -> UI -> Windows Form
- Redefine your main to be similar to windows form main
- Make sure entry point is defined correctly
- Add AssemblyInfo



## notes

### general stuff
- casts come before addition
- item ID is 2 byte value, 100 means empty
 - first byte is something
 - second represent something else

- for environment items, flags comes before (x, y)
- for inventory, flags also comes before (x, y) but is -1, -1

items
- kept track of either in the env or inventory
- there is one item in the player struct but it's also the first item in the inventory ???? wdf
- seems like items are generated once you enter. possible autoid hack
- if you have n items in your inventory, there are n+1 contiguous blocks of memory ready to recieve the inventory items
- there is no deallocation if you drop items
- thus you must look for reliable inventory slot id, which is always +1 from the last if the spot has been allocated before
   - technically you don't need to, the env items seem to be laid out right after the inventory ones
   - ID all env ones so items will stack properly

primary id's
potion: 7
scrolls: 5

05 10 is acquirement
0A 00 is orb of zot lmfao



### entities
- they're 0x138 or 312 apart
172 from the 4 byte -1 on the right
- cannot just set hp to 0, they need to clean up pointers for items held and stuff
- can easily stasis monsters

seems like in memory:
- environment items
- environment entities





crawl-tiles.exe+23D40
looks to be updateXandY function
- it is the global update x and y, affects player too

given an empty "enemy" in the environment, you can force an enemy to spawn by setting x, y, health, maxhealth, speed and the 27001 thing



address crawl-tiles.exe + BE1C20 stores a bunch of item dealing offsets:
for example, scroll is crawl-tiles.exe + 5E2E55 + BE1C20

### Possible incoming features
+ acquirement on command; opengl calls are failing tho
+ turn trainer on and off
+ Tile-based kill aura
+ Click to blink? (seems like a good fcn hook lesson)
+ No negative status effects
+ Remove negative mutations
+ Unlock all spells
+ uncurse/curse all items (for Ashenzari)
+ Account for race aptitudes in skill levels
+ See if you can hook Shaft Self
